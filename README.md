## Nimified Topdown Tank Battle

Make sure you have Godot(currently using Godot 3.1 alpha 2) and Nim(0.18.0) and the [bindings](https://github.com/pragmagic/godot-nim) installed when you want to try these out. Run `nake build` in a samples directory to get started.
This example shows a lot more of the engine, mostly signals and structuring a project.

### TODO

Rest of the parts of the tutorial, 8 to 11 currently. But the rest of the parts are quite short and add some more refinement 
to the game. Not much I could learn from the other parts that focus on programming better in Godot and Nim, so for now I'll leave it as is and try to get more different kind of samples.
